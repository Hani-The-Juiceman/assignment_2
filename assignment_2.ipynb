This can paritally be justified by the fact that pandas did not have problems inferring the \"proper\" datatypes (e.g., numbers types as string would result in an object column) and your subsequent check of the data types. Therefore, you can use `df.isna()` as a proxy indicator for missing values.)"

This is actually quite commen as this applies to 64365 counties which is 87% of our data. On the other hand counties with 0 men or women probably do not exist."
